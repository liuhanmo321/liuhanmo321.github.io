I am a forth-year PhD candidate in Data Science and Analytics, HKUST. My reserach interest lies in efficient machine learning, including continual learning on different data modalities and efficient auto machine learning. I am honoured to be supervised by Prof. [CHEN, Lei](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~leichen/). Prior to my PhD study, I received my B.Sc. degree in Honors Physics and Computer Science from HKUST in 2021.
